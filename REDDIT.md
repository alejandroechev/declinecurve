## Post 1: r/petroleum

**Title:** I built a free browser-based Arps decline curve analysis tool — exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic fitting

**Body:**

Built a free web app for Arps decline curve analysis. It fits exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic decline models to your production data, calculates EUR, and generates production forecasts.

Automatically selects the best-fit model using R² and AIC comparison. Just paste your rate-time data and it does the rest — decline rate, b-factor, EUR, and forecast plot.

No IHS Harmony license needed. No install, no login, runs in your browser.

Would love feedback from reservoir/production engineers — what features would make this practical for your work?

## Post 2: r/oilandgasworkers

**Title:** Free decline curve analysis tool — Arps DCA in your browser, no expensive software

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based tool for Arps decline curve analysis. Paste your production data, it fits exponential/hyperbolic/harmonic models and gives you EUR and a production forecast.

No IHS license, no install, no account. Works on any device with a browser. Open source too.

What would make this useful for people in the field? Looking for feedback from anyone who does production forecasting.

## Post 3: r/energy

**Title:** Free browser tool for petroleum decline curve analysis — Arps models, EUR calculation, production forecasting

**Body:**

I'm building free engineering tools for the energy industry. DeclineCurve does Arps decline curve analysis — fits exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic models to well production data and calculates estimated ultimate recovery.

All open source, runs client-side, no data leaves your browser. The goal is making basic reservoir engineering tools accessible without expensive software licenses.

Feedback from petroleum engineers would be really valuable.
